//Create charts on the fly and wrap them with function =IMAGE()to display in sheet. 
For example : 
https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p3&chs=250x100&chd=t:60,40&chl=Hello|World

//Using a combination of sumifs, Indirect and Vlookup to summarise multiple metrics that meets a set of drop down criteria across timespan.
// by coding the formula this way, it could be quickly replicated across the entire table. Vlookup and Indirect formula helps to automate by referencing the column location from a separate table, removing the tedious need to code the location of the raw data of each metric. 

=sumifs(INDIRECT(vlookup(Column name that matches the raw data table, specify the table where the arguement could be found in the leftmost column, to return the data on the 3rd column of the table, to match the search exactly)), meets criteria 1 of sumifs formula, and meets certeria 2 of sumifs formula. 
=sumifs(INDIRECT(vlookup(C$7,List!$C$2:$E$18,3,false)),Raw!$A:$A,$B8,Raw!$F:$F,$C$4)

// Use this Array formula to automate sequential dates in the sheet. 

=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,1,SEQUENCE(60))) // List 60 Days from 1st Jan 2021
=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,SEQUENCE(12),1)) // List 12 Months from 1st Jan, broken down in months
=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,SEQUENCE(12,1,1,3),1)) // List 12 entries starting from Jan 2021 (1st month) with an incremental step size of 3 months in between.   
=SEQUENCE(5,1,TODAY(),1) // List 5 days starting from today 

SEQUENCE function allows you to define if the data  will display in sequencial column or row.
Arguments of SEQUENCE function are 1) the number of rows, 2) the number of columns, 3) a start value, and 4) a step size. 
Note that SEQUENCE does not work with volatile functions (RAND, RANDBETWEEN) as it strips off its functionality of generating random number. The incremental step size only allows for positive and negative integers, not decimals.

Array formula with sumif formulas
This is useful if you want the latest data to populate without manually dragging down a formula. Unfortunately, the function Sumifs canâ€™t expand with arrays, In other words, it returns a single cell output.
To code this, you should use the function ArrayFormula together with Sumif (single). Another requirement is to use "&" to joins multiple criteria and its corresponding columns.

This simple array formula will automatically do the summation when a new data is added : 
=ArrayFormula(sumif(A2:A&B2:B,E3:E4&F3:F4,C2:C))
The complete formula that takes a new data input in each month, and otherwise returns a blank cell : 
=Arrayformula(if(isblank(B17:B),,(sumif(Process!$A:$A&Process!$B:$B&Process!$T:$T,B17:B&$C$16&$A$1,Process!$G:$G))))
