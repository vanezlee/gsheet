TABLE FORMATTING FOR ANALYSIS to maximize legibility.

1) Center align headings
So the spacing across the header row is consistent.

2) Make headings bold
So they stand out from regular data in your columns.

3) Wrap text in header row
To ensure all the column headings are immediately readable.

4) Freeze the top row

5) Add filters
So you're ready to go with the next steps of your analysis.
 
To format first column for analysis, use the following app script to automate STEPS 1 - 5.

//To activate, Clear all existing format with ctrl\ and highlight the 1st row.

function formatforanalysis() {
  var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  spreadsheet.getActiveRangeList().setHorizontalAlignment('center')
  .setFontWeight('bold')
  .setWrapStrategy(SpreadsheetApp.WrapStrategy.WRAP);
  spreadsheet.getActiveSheet().setFrozenRows(1);
  spreadsheet.getActiveRange().createFilter();
};


//Absolute custom format shortens and make huge numbers more readable (usually in the millions and more). Formatting changes how the figure is displayed on the front end, but does not change the actual figure. Hence making any further computation on the figures accurate.
[<999950]0.0,"K";[<999950000]0.0,,"M";0.0,,,"B"

//Use the following format to insert currency into a custom format (replace $US)
[$US$][<999950]0.0,"K";[$US$][<999950000]0.0,,"M";[$US$]0.0,,,"B"

//If the currency is in the negative form, use the following custom format instead (replace $US): 
[$US$][<999950]-0.0,"K";[$US$][<999950000]-0.0,,"M";[$US$]-0.0,,,"B"
