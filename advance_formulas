//Create charts on the fly and wrap them with function =IMAGE()to display in sheet. 
For example :

//Using a combination of sumifs, Indirect and Vlookup to summarise multiple metrics that meet any criteria by duration. 
// by coding the formula this way, the formula could be quickly replicated across the entire table. 
// Vlookup helps to automate the Indirect formula further by referencing the column location a separate table, removing the tedious need to code raw data location of each metric column. 

=sumifs(INDIRECT(vlookup(Column name that matches the raw data table, specify the table where the arguement could be found in the leftmost column, to return the data on the 3rd column of the table, to match the search exactly)), meets criteria 1 of sumifs formula, and meets certeria 2 of sumifs formula. 
=sumifs(INDIRECT(vlookup(C$7,List!$C$2:$E$18,3,false)),Raw!$A:$A,$B8,Raw!$F:$F,$C$4)

// Use this Array formula to automate sequential dates in the sheet. 
=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,1,SEQUENCE(60))) // List 60 Days from 1st Jan 2021
=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,SEQUENCE(12),1)) // List 12 Months from 1st Jan, broken down in months
=ArrayFormula(DATE(2021,SEQUENCE(12,1,1,3),1)) // List 12 entries starting from Jan 2021 (1st month) with an incremental step size of 3 months in between.   
=SEQUENCE(5,1,TODAY(),1) // List 5 days starting from today 

Sequence function allows you to define if the data is in sequencial columns or row format, and define its start value, and the step size.
Arguments of SEQUENCE function are 1) the number of rows, 2) the number of columns, 3) a start value, and 4) a step size.
